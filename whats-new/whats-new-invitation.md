# Project Membership, Invitations & Email Notifications

We have updated SyRF's project membership administration, invitation, and email notification features. 

For public projects, SyRF users can now request to join all projects that require approval. [Read more here](../nav-project-settings.html). 


Project Administrators now have the ability to: 

* Invite new members to join your SyRF project. [Read more here](../member-inviting.html).
* Accept or decline requests to join your SyRF project.  [Read more here](../member-respond-join.html).
* Assign members to groups. [Read more here](../members-groups.html). 
* Configure their projects (visibility, access settings and transfer of ownership).  [Read more here](../nav-project-settings#visibility--access.html).
