# Advanced Annotation Settings
 
We have added a [data-export](../data-export.html) feature which allows bibliographic, screening, and annotation data to be downloaded in .csv format. 

We have updated SyRFâ€™s functionality for stage annotation settings.  

Project administrators have further configuration control over: 
* Advanced stage settings, specifically annotation settings

Further, detailed progress bar information is now for available for all users conducting screening and annotation.

If you have any further questions, please contact us at [help.syrf@org.uk](help.syrf@org.uk)
