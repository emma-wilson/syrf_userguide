  <h1>Signing In - Important Information</h1>
  <h3>4th May 2022</h3>
  <p>
    We have upgraded SyRF’s Sign In System. As part of this upgrade, you are required to set a new secure password.
  </p>

    <div class="side-by-side">
      <p>
        When signing in, SyRF will take you to a new welcome landing page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here you can select whether you wish to sign in using either:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>An email & password by entering your email address and pressing 'Continue'.</li>
        <li>Sign in using a social sign-in. E.g. Google by pressing 'Continue with Google'.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="email+password">Users who sign in using an email & password</h2>
  <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
    <div class="side-by-side">
      <p>
        You will be required to reset your password to a new secure standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the ‘Enter your password’ page click on the ‘Forgot your password?’. This will send you an email with a link
        to reset your password.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your new password should contain:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>At least 8 characters</li>
        <li>At least 3 of the following:
          <ul>
            <li> Lower case letters (a-z)</li>
            <li>Upper case letters (A-Z)</li>
            <li>Numbers (0-9)</li>
            <li>Special characters (ex. !@~$%^&*)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

  </div>
  <h2 id="social-signin">Users who sign in with an external login e.g. Google</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Before re-linking an external login you will first need to set a secure password for your SyRF account. This can
      be done by following the instructions for '<a href="#email+password">Users who sign in using an email & password</a>' above.</p>
    <p>
      After your first time authenticating with your social sign-in (e.g. Google) you will be required to re-link your
      social sign-in to your SyRF account.
    </p>

    <p>
      Follow the instructions under ‘Existing SyRF account’ making sure to enter the email already associated with
      your SyRF account and the new secure password you set following the instructions above.
    </p>
    <p>You can now sign in to SyRF using your external login.</p>
